### Hi, I'm Igor! 👋

I'm an Economics student venturing into the world of programming. I have experience with **R** for statistical analysis and I am currently taking my first steps with **Python**.

I'm focused on learning how to use technology to better understand economic data.

Always learning, one line of code at a time. 🚀
